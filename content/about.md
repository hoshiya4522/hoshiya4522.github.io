I'm a 17 y/o boy studying in class 12 in Bangladesh whose knowledge is basically at the surface level. But I can say that I have more knowledge than I had yesterday.

The reason for me making a blog is to learn more about stuff I already kind of know it or want to master it. Because, I try not to post something that is wrong or false.

As Richard Fynman once said,

> *"If you want to master something, teach it.
The more you teach, the better you learn.
Teaching is a powerful tool to learning."*
