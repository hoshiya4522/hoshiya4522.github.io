Today when I was doom scrolling on YouTube I came accross [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nusg5dUjR0A) video by The Primagen talking about the biggest takes on programming. There was a part where writing a program about swapping the values of two variables without a temporary variable was mentioned. I thought how it was done in C. After a quick googling I came accross [this article](https://www.javatpoint.com/c-program-to-swap-two-numbers-without-using-third-variable) and the code was kinda interesting.

I'm currently learning and using C because of school. But before that I used Python for most of my projects.
In python to swap the value of two variables without a third variable is pretty easy!

```python
x = 3
y = 5

x, y = y, x

print(x) # 5
print(y) # 3
```
